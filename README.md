# Rosalind Bioinformatics Exercises

This repository contains solutions to bioinformatics problems from [Rosalind](https://rosalind.info/problems/list-view).
Iâ€™m using these exercises to practice programming and computational biology concepts.

## Topics covered
- DNA and RNA string manipulation
- Translation and transcription
- Motif finding
- GC content calculation
- Mendelian inheritance
- Graph-based problems (e.g., overlap graphs)

## Running the code
All solutions are written in Python.  
To run an exercise:
```bash
python dna_into_rna.py
